This program uses the Total Phase Cheetah SPI Host adapter (and optionally the
Total Phase Aardvark Host Adapter to make use of the SPI IRQ output) to read
audio out from Avona to a PC over the SPI interface. In order to run this
program, the Cheetah (and optionally Aardvark) shared library binary file
must be obtained at the following links.

For the host wakeup simulation, both the Aardvark and Cheetah devices are
required. The Aardvark is connected to the wakeword detected IRQ and the audio
available IRQ lines. The Cheetah, acting as a SPI master at 4 MHz, is connected
to the SPI interface to transfer audio from the xcore to the host.

The Cheetah's SPI interface's MOSI, MISO, and SCK lines must be connected
to the Explorer board's WIFI MOSI, MISO, and CLK lines respectively that are
found on connector J6. The Cheetah's remaining SS line must be connected to
pin 2 on J14, which is labeled "00" on the Explorer board. Finally, both of the
Cheetah's GND wires must be connected to ground pins on the Explorer board.

The Aardvark's "SCL" and "SDA" lines must be connected to the Explorer board's
WIFI WIRQ and WUP lines respectively that are found on connector J6. At least
one of the Aardvark's GND wires must be connected to a ground pin on the
Explorer board.

After running compiling and running the "spi_read" program, the wakeword must
be spoken within 10 seconds, which will start the recording. After the program
exists, the recording can be listed to by running the command:
aplay -c2 -r16000 -fS16_LE  audio.dat

If aplay is unavailable, audio.dat, may also be imported into Audacity.
audio.dat is in "raw" format with two signed 16 bit channels at 16 KHz.
