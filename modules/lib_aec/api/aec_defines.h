/** @brief Maximum total number of phases supported in the AEC library 
 * This is the maximum number of total phases supported in the AEC library. Total phases are calculated by summing
 * phases across adaptive filters for all x-y pairs.
 *
 * For example. for a 2 y-channels, 2 x-channels, 10 phases per x channel configuration, there are 4 adaptive filters,
 * H_hat<SUB>y0x0</SUB>, H_hat<SUB>y0x1</SUB>, H_hat<SUB>y1x0</SUB> and H_hat<SUB>y1x1</SUB>, each filter having 10
 * phases, so the total number of phases is 40.
 * When aec_init() is called to initialise the AEC, the num_y_channels, num_x_channels and num_main_filter_phases
 * parameters passed in should be such that num_y_channels * num_x_channels * num_main_filter_phases is less than equal
 * to AEC_LIB_MAX_PHASES. 
 *
 * This define is only used when defining data structures within the AEC state structure. The AEC algorithm
 * implementation uses the num_main_filter_phases and num_shadow_filter_phases values that are passed into aec_init().
