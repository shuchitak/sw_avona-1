	  Defines the size of the "up" RTT buffer (target -> host) to use for writing
	  the trace data, for RTT buffer 1 or higher.
	  
	  This setting is ignored for RTT buffer 0, which can't be reconfigured
	  in runtime and therefore hard-coded to use the defines in SEGGER_RTT_Conf.h.
	  
	  Default buffer size for Tracealyzer is 5000 bytes.
	  If you have a stand-alone J-Link probe, the can be decreased to around 1 KB.
	  But integrated J-Link OB interfaces are slower and needs about 5-10 KB,
	  depending on the amount of data produced.

	default PERCEPIO_RECORDER_SEGGER_RTT_MODE_NO_BLOCK_SKIP
	help
	  This stream port for J-Link streaming relies on SEGGER RTT, that contains an
	  internal RAM buffer read by the J-Link probes during execution.
	  
	  Possible values:
	    - SEGGER_RTT_MODE_BLOCK_IF_FIFO_FULL
	    - SEGGER_RTT_MODE_NO_BLOCK_SKIP (default)
	  
	  Using SEGGER_RTT_MODE_BLOCK_IF_FIFO_FULL ensure that you get a
	  complete and valid trace. This may however cause blocking if your streaming
	  interface isn't fast enough, which may disturb the real-time behavior.
	  
	  We therefore recommend SEGGER_RTT_MODE_NO_BLOCK_SKIP. In this mode,
	  Tracealyzer will report lost events if the transfer is not
	  fast enough. In that case, try increasing the size of the "up buffer".
