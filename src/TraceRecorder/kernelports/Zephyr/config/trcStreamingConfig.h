 * @def TRC_CFG_ISR_TAILCHAINING_THRESHOLD
 *
 * @brief Macro which should be defined as an integer value.
 *
 * If tracing multiple ISRs, this setting allows for accurate display of the 
 * context-switching also in cases when the ISRs execute in direct sequence.
 * 
 * vTraceStoreISREnd normally assumes that the ISR returns to the previous
 * context, i.e., a task or a preempted ISR. But if another traced ISR 
 * executes in direct sequence, Tracealyzer may incorrectly display a minimal
 * fragment of the previous context in between the ISRs.
 *
 * By using TRC_CFG_ISR_TAILCHAINING_THRESHOLD you can avoid this. This is 
 * however a threshold value that must be measured for your specific setup.
 * See http://percepio.com/2014/03/21/isr_tailchaining_threshold/
 *
 * The default setting is 0, meaning "disabled" and that you may get an 
 * extra fragments of the previous context in between tail-chained ISRs.
 *
 * Note: This setting has separate definitions in trcSnapshotConfig.h and 
 * trcStreamingConfig.h, since it is affected by the recorder mode.
