 * ignored.
 *
 * User Events are application-generated events, like "printf" but for the 
 * trace log, generated using vTracePrint and vTracePrintF. 
 * The formatting is done on host-side, by Tracealyzer. User Events are 
 * therefore much faster than a console printf and can often be used
 * in timing critical code without problems.
 *
 * Note: In streaming mode, User Events are used to provide error messages
 * and warnings from the recorder (in case of incorrect configuration) for
 * display in Tracealyzer. Disabling user events will also disable these
 * warnings. You can however still catch them by calling xTraceGetLastError

 *
 * Macro which should be defined as either zero (0) or one (1).
 *
 * If this is zero (0), the code for recording Interrupt Service Routines is
 * excluded, in order to reduce code size. This means that any calls to
 * vTraceStoreISRBegin/vTraceStoreISREnd will be ignored.
 * This does not completely disable ISR tracing, in cases where an ISR is
 * calling a traced kernel service. These events will still be recorded and
 * show up in anonymous ISR instances in Tracealyzer, with names such as
 * "ISR sending to <queue name>".
 * To disable such tracing, please refer to vTraceSetFilterGroup and 
 * vTraceSetFilterMask.

 * the execution state, and present accurate response times.
 * If zero (0), "ready events" are not created, which allows for recording

 * is always created by the recorder when in streaming mode.

 * This defines how many tasks that will be subject to stack usage analysis for
 * each execution of the Tracealyzer Control task (TzCtrl). Note that the stack
 * monitoring cycles between the tasks, so this does not affect WHICH tasks that
 * are monitored, but HOW OFTEN each task stack is analyzed. 
 *
 * This setting can be combined with TRC_CFG_CTRL_TASK_DELAY to tune the
 * frequency of the stack monitoring. This is motivated since the stack analysis
 * can take some time to execute.
 * However, note that the stack analysis runs in a separate task (TzCtrl) that
 * can be executed on low priority. This way, you can avoid that the stack
 * analysis disturbs any time-sensitive tasks.

 * make sure the TzCtrl priority is high enough to ensure reliable periodic
 * execution and transfer of the data, but low enough to avoid disturbing any 
 * time-sensitive functions.
 *
 * In Snapshot mode, TzCtrl is only used for the stack usage monitoring and is
 * not created if stack monitoring is disabled. TRC_CFG_CTRL_TASK_PRIORITY should

 * 
 * In streaming mode, this also affects the trace data transfer if you are using

 * logs an error message. This setting is used to allocate an internal stack

 * the recorder would be initialized by vTraceEnable(TRC_INIT) but could then

 * is unspecified by compilers.

 *    extern uint32_t RecorderInitialized;
