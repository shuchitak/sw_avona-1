 * Configuration Macro: TRC_CFG_HARDWARE_PORT
 *
 * Specify what hardware port to use (i.e., the "timestamping driver").
 *
 * All ARM Cortex-M MCUs are supported by "TRC_HARDWARE_PORT_ARM_Cortex_M".
 * This port uses the DWT cycle counter for Cortex-M3/M4/M7 devices, which is
 * available on most such devices. In case your device don't have DWT support,
 * you will get an error message opening the trace. In that case, you may
 * force the recorder to use SysTick timestamping instead, using this define:
 *
 * #define TRC_CFG_ARM_CM_USE_SYSTICK
 *
 * For ARM Cortex-M0/M0+ devices, SysTick mode is used automatically.
 *
 * See trcHardwarePort.h for available ports and information on how to
 * define your own port, if not already present.

 * transferred continuously to the host PC.

 * TRC_CFG_SCHEDULING_ONLY
 *
 * Macro which should be defined as an integer value.
 *
 * If this setting is enabled (= 1), only scheduling events are recorded.
 * If disabled (= 0), all events are recorded (unless filtered in other ways).
 *
 * Default value is 0 (= include additional events).
 ******************************************************************************/

 /******************************************************************************
 * TRC_CFG_INCLUDE_USER_EVENTS
 *
 * Macro which should be defined as either zero (0) or one (1).
 *
 * If this is zero (0), all code related to User Events is excluded in order 
 * to reduce code size. Any attempts of storing User Events are then silently
 * ignored.
 *
 * User Events are application-generated events, like "printf" but for the 
 * trace log, generated using vTracePrint and vTracePrintF. 
 * The formatting is done on host-side, by Tracealyzer. User Events are 
 * therefore much faster than a console printf and can often be used
 * in timing critical code without problems.
 *
 * Note: In streaming mode, User Events are used to provide error messages
 * and warnings from the recorder (in case of incorrect configuration) for
 * display in Tracealyzer. Disabling user events will also disable these
 * warnings. You can however still catch them by calling xTraceGetLastError
 * or by putting breakpoints in prvTraceError and prvTraceWarning.
 *
 * Default value is 1.

 /*****************************************************************************
 * TRC_CFG_INCLUDE_ISR_TRACING
 *
 * Macro which should be defined as either zero (0) or one (1).
 *
 * If this is zero (0), the code for recording Interrupt Service Routines is
 * excluded, in order to reduce code size. This means that any calls to
 * vTraceStoreISRBegin/vTraceStoreISREnd will be ignored.
 * This does not completely disable ISR tracing, in cases where an ISR is
 * calling a traced kernel service. These events will still be recorded and
 * show up in anonymous ISR instances in Tracealyzer, with names such as
 * "ISR sending to <queue name>".
 * To disable such tracing, please refer to vTraceSetFilterGroup and 
 * vTraceSetFilterMask.
 *
 * Default value is 1.
 *
 * Note: tracing ISRs requires that you insert calls to vTraceStoreISRBegin
 * and vTraceStoreISREnd in your interrupt handlers.

 /*****************************************************************************
 * TRC_CFG_INCLUDE_READY_EVENTS
 *
 * Macro which should be defined as either zero (0) or one (1).
 *
 * If one (1), events are recorded when tasks enter scheduling state "ready".
 * This allows Tracealyzer to show the initial pending time before tasks enter
 * the execution state, and present accurate response times.
 * If zero (0), "ready events" are not created, which allows for recording
 * longer traces in the same amount of RAM.
 *
 * Default value is 1.

 /*****************************************************************************
 * TRC_CFG_INCLUDE_OSTICK_EVENTS
 *
 * Macro which should be defined as either zero (0) or one (1).
 *
 * If this is one (1), events will be generated whenever the OS clock is
 * increased. If zero (0), OS tick events are not generated, which allows for
 * recording longer traces in the same amount of RAM.
 *
 * Default value is 1.

 /*******************************************************************************
 * Configuration Macro: TRC_CFG_CTRL_TASK_PRIORITY
 *
 * The priority of the TzCtrl task, that receive commands from Tracealyzer and
 * report stack usage.
 * Most stream ports also rely on the TzCtrl task to transmit the data from the
 * internal buffer to the stream interface (all except for the J-Link port).
 * For such ports, make sure the TzCtrl priority is high enough to ensure
 * reliable periodic execution and transfer of the data.
 ******************************************************************************/

 /*******************************************************************************
 * Configuration Macro: TRC_CFG_CTRL_TASK_DELAY
 *
 * The delay between every loop of the TzCtrl task. A high delay will reduce the
 * CPU load, but may cause missed events if the TzCtrl task is performing the
 * trace transfer when in Streaming Mode. It will also reduce the frequency of
 * the unused stack reports.
 ******************************************************************************/
#define TRC_CFG_CTRL_TASK_DELAY 10

/******************************************************************************
 * TRC_CFG_MAX_ISR_NESTING
 *
 * Defines how many levels of interrupt nesting the recorder can handle, in
 * case multiple ISRs are traced and ISR nesting is possible. If this
 * is exceeded, the particular ISR will not be traced and the recorder then
 * logs an error message. This setting is used to allocate an internal stack
 * for keeping track of the previous execution context (4 byte per entry).
 *
 * This value must be a non-zero positive constant, at least 1.
 *
 * Default value: 8
 *****************************************************************************/
#define TRC_CFG_MAX_ISR_NESTING 8

 /*******************************************************************************
 * TRC_CFG_RECORDER_DATA_INIT
 *
 * Macro which states wether the recorder data should have an initial value.
 *
 * In very specific cases where traced objects are created before main(),
 * the recorder will need to be started even before that. In these cases,
 * the recorder would be initialized by vTraceEnable(TRC_INIT) but could then
 * later be overwritten by the initialization value because initialization order
 * is unspecified by compilers.
 * If this is an issue for you, set TRC_CFG_RECORDER_DATA_INIT to 0.
 * The following code can then be used before any traced objects are created:
 *
 *    extern uint32_t RecorderInitialized;
 *    RecorderInitialized = 0;
 *    vTraceEnable(TRC_INIT);
 *
 * After the hardware and clocks are properly initialized, use 
 * vTraceEnable(TRC_START) to start the tracing.
 *
 * Default value is 1.

 /******************************************************************************
 * TRC_CFG_RECORDER_DATA_ATTRIBUTE
 *
 * When setting TRC_CFG_RECORDER_DATA_INIT to 0, you might also need to make
 * sure certain recorder data is placed in a specific RAM section to avoid being
 * zeroed out after initialization. Define TRC_CFG_RECORDER_DATA_ATTRIBUTE as
 * that attribute.
 *
 * Example:
 * #define TRC_CFG_RECORDER_DATA_ATTRIBUTE __attribute__((section(".bss.trace_recorder_data")))
 *
 * Default value is empty.
